# Challenge data collection Immo Eliza
The provided Python 3 program performs data analysis on a CSV file containing house details. The code utilizes various libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data manipulation, cleaning, visualization, and analysis.

The clean_data function is responsible for preprocessing the data. It drops duplicate rows based on the 'id' column, removes leading and trailing white spaces from string columns, updates specific columns based on given conditions, drops rows with missing values, and performs some data transformations.

The analyze_data function conducts data analysis and generates visualizations. It calculates the number of rows and columns, filters out properties without a price, calculates the average price per region and visualizes it using a bar plot, explores correlations between variables and price, examines the influence of variables on price, calculates the percentage of missing values, identifies outliers using a scatter plot, suggests variables to delete based on their importance and missing values, creates a histogram to represent the distribution of property surfaces, determines the most important variables based on personal opinion, identifies the most expensive municipalities in Belgium, Wallonia, and Flanders in terms of average price, median price, and price per square meter, and lists the least expensive municipalities in Belgium.

The code demonstrates various data analysis techniques and provides insights into the house market based on the given dataset. It showcases data cleaning, visualization, and interpretation skills in Python.

Please note that the provided description assumes the code is functioning correctly and produces the expected results.
